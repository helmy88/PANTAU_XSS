Overview
This script detects potential XSS vulnerabilities in web pages by analyzing their HTML content. It checks for the presence of `<script>` tags and other common patterns that might indicate an XSS attack.

 Usage
1. Running the Script:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.
   - Install required dependencies (`requests` and `beautifulsoup4`) using `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`.
   - Run the script using the command:
    
     python XSS.py [target_url]
   
     Alternatively, if you omit `[target_url]`, the script will prompt you to enter a URL.

2. Output:
   - The script will fetch the HTML content from the specified URL.
   - It will then check for the presence of `<script>` tags in the HTML.
   - If an XSS vulnerability is detected, it will print:
    
     Potential XSS vulnerability detected in: [target_url]
     Script causing XSS: <script>alert("xss")</script>
     
   - If no vulnerabilities are found, it will print:
     
     No XSS vulnerability detected in: [target_url]
 

3. Additional Notes:
   - The script uses `requests` to fetch the web page content and `BeautifulSoup` to parse and search through the HTML.
   - It detects `<script>` tags as well as other potential XSS indicators.
   - For detailed analysis or further customization, review and modify the script as needed.
